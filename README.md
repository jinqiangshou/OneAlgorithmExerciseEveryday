# OneAlgorithmExerciseEveryday

I will complete at least one algorithm exercise every day and post my answers here.
The algorithm exercises are from https://leetcode.com.

There are 3 folders in this repository:

1. The folder "c-cpp" contains solutions using C/C++;

2. The folder "javascript" contains solutions using Javascript;

3. The folder "java" contains solutions using Java.
 
In the first round, I will choose one of the three kinds of programming language to finish each exercise. 
In the second round, I will rewrite my answers in the other two languages. 
In this way we get comprehensive coding practice. 

Come on!
